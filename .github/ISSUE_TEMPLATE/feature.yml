        I'm trying to [describe your use case], but the current SDK doesn't support [specific functionality]. 
        
        For example:
        - "I need to track custom user events with complex metadata"
        - "I want to integrate with push notifications but need better control over timing"
        - "I'm looking for offline data synchronization capabilities"

      placeholder: |-
        I envision this working like...
        
        For example:
        - "A new method like `Luciq.trackCustomEvent(name: String, properties: [String: Any])` that allows..."
        - "An optional delegate protocol that gets called when..."
        - "A configuration option that enables..."
        
        Feel free to include:
        ‚Ä¢ API examples or pseudo-code
        ‚Ä¢ UI/UX considerations
        ‚Ä¢ Performance requirements
        ‚Ä¢ Integration patterns you'd prefer
